Given a string str_in, replace every instance of character c1 with c2.
Ignore case of the character being replaced (meaning replace both upper and lowercase instances of c1)
	Input: 
		str_in = 'Hello WorLd' 
		c1 = 'l'
		c2 = 'o'
	Output:
		'Heooo Worod'

def replace_char(str_in, c1, c2):
	pass




"""
Replace every character in the string with the next character in the alphabet. 
Make sure to replace 'Z' and 'z' with 'A' and 'a' respectively.
	Input:
		'abcDe'
	Output:
		'bcdEf'

"""
Given a list, remove all the duplicate elements. 
Return a list of the elements after the duplicates are removed.
	Input:
		[1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
	Output:
		[1,2,3,4,5,6]

def remove_duplicates(my_list):
	pass





"""
Given two ordered lists (they can be of different lengths). 
Return a list of the elements that the lists share in common with duplicates removed.
Make sure your resulting list is in order.
	Input:
		[1,2,3], [2,3,5,6,7]
	Output:
		[2,3]

def overlap(list_a, List_b):
	pass




"""
This function takes in two functions and a list. Apply func1 to each element in the list first (remember to store the results).
Then apply func2 to the resulting list. Return the result of applying func2 on the list.
	Input: int, sum, ['1', '2']
	Output: 3

Given an input string str_in, replace every instance of string str1 with str2.
Ingore case when replacing str1 (so replace both upper and lowercase isntances of str1)
	Input:
		str_in = 'abcdefAbCefG'
		str1 = 'abc'
		str2 = ' '
	Output:
		' def efG'
